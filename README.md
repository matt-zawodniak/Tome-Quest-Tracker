#  Tome: Quest Tracker

Tome is a gamified to-do list app that motivates the user to be productive. Users set their own tasks and rewards, and Tome gives users experience upon completion of a task. Every time a user earns enough experience they level up and they receive a reward that they've set themselves. Only the user knows the best way to motivate themselves!

Tome works with Siri to allow easy creation and completion of quests. It also stores quests on iCloud for cross-device synchronization.

##  Quests

Adding a quest is as easy as hitting the + button. All a quest requires is a name and a type, though things like due date, difficulty, or time investment can also be adjusted and can affect the experience earned by the user.

Quests are separated into four types: Main, Side, Daily, and Weekly. Each quest type gives a different amount of experience based on importance and effort.

Main quests are important and/or urgent tasks. They give the most experience.
Side quests are smaller or less urgent tasks.
Daily quests are tasks the user should be doing every day. At the end of every day they repopulate, so the user can cross them off their list and the quest will be active again tomorrow!
Weekly quests are tasks the user tries to do once a week. At the end of every week they repopulate, so the user can cross them off their list and the quest will be active again tomorrow!

Once a user has added a quest to Tome, they can use swipe, tap, or voice actions to edit, delete, or complete the quest. Once completed, the user will receive the associated amount of experience and the quest will move to the completed quests list. Quests in the completed quest list can be edited, deleted or re-activated.

##  Rewards

Rewards are separated into Minor and Milestone rewards. Every time the user levels up they receive a reward, with every 5th level being a Milestone reward! It is recommended to keep minor rewards as smaller rewards, with Milestone rewards being larger. For example, if a user food motivated, a Minor reward could be ice cream, while a Milestone reward might be a trip to their favorite restaurant. The next reward to be earned always comes from the top of the list, so users should add whatever they think might help them stay motivated to be productive!

Once a reward is earned, it shows up in the earned rewards list for the user to claim whenever they take advantage of it.

## Settings

In settings, the user can change when daily and weekly quests reset. For example, if the user is a night owl perhaps they would prefer quests to reset at 4AM so they can accomplish some tasks late at night before bed. Or, if trash day is Wednesday, perhaps weekly quests should reset on Tuesday so the user doesn't forget to take out the trash. Users can be notified 24 hours before weekly reset if they so choose.

Users can also adjust the level scaling of Tome. If set to hard, the amount of experience needed to level goes up by a small amount every time they level up. This is ideal for users who wish to slowly wean themselves off of using rewards to motivate productivity, or for those who wish for a more "classic" gaming feel. This setting can always be switched back, so if the user reaches a satisfactory leveling difficulty they can swap the level scaling back to normal to stop the maximum experience from increasing.

## Siri Actions

Tome comes with two built-in actions to use with Siri. Users can say “Add quest” or “create quest” to add a new quest to Tome. The follow-up prompt allows the user to specify the type of quest it is. Users can also say “complete quest” or “mark quest as complete” to have Siri complete the quest for them without having to open the app.
